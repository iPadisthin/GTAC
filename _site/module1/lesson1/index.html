<h2 class="lesson-title">Lesson 1 – Establishing prior knowledge and questions to investigate the statement: One in every three mouthfuls of food we eat relies on bees</h2>

<div class="container">
    <section class="one-third well">
        <h3>Lesson Purpose</h3>
        <p>The context of this lesson is based on the scientific concept of “one in every three mouthfuls of food we eat relies on bees”.</p> 
        <p>The process and products of pollination are explored through the connection between bees, flowers and the food we eat. “It is estimated that 65% of all flowering plants and some seed plants (e.g. cycads and pines) require insects for pollination” (“Pollination”, 2015). On the other hand, insects like bees require certain type of plants for their main source of food – pollen.</p>
        <p class="highlight">In summary, this lesson will focus on what makes living organisms unique and what helps them survive and work together.</p>

        <h3>Success criteria (Learning Outcomes)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Students use visual models and language as a metacognition tool to explore the concept “One in every three mouthfuls of food we eat relies on bees”.</li>
            <li>Students use effective questioning to negotiate meaning and construct a shared narrative to explore the connection between bees and the foods that we eat.</li> 
            <li>Students construct a KWHL chart to collect and organise information as they research an idea.</li>
            <li>Students pose questions and suggest methods that can be used to research their questions.</li> 
        </ul>

        <h3>Teacher notes</h3>
        <p>This lesson applies a series of techniques that guide student thinking and exploration of the following concept presented by scientists and mathematicians: “one in every three mouthfuls of food relies on bees”.</p>
        <p>A card sorting activity is used to practise skills in using visual models and language to develop scientific thinking and activate prior knowledge. Students apply effective questioning techniques to share prior knowledge and formulate ideas in their teams.</p>
        <p>The teacher uses between table instruction to demonstrate and promote effective questioning techniques (<a href="">Talk Moves</a>) that prompt students to justify their thinking through reasoning and negotiation of meaning.</p>
        <p>Students apply a KWHL chart as a method to collect and organise information to guide research.</p>
        <p>Think, Pair, Share is utilised to help students learn to develop questions and think about methods that can be used to research these questions.</p>

        <h3>Common alternative conceptions (misconceptions):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Bees make honey so one in three mouthfuls of our food contains honey.</li> 
            <li>Food only comes from a supermarket.</li>
            <li>Bees carry seeds (e.g.: sunflower to sunflower).</li>
            <li>Bees hurt the flower / plant. They just take from them.</li>
            <li>Bees eat flowers (rather than collect nectar and pollen).</li>
            <li>Bees are only involved in honey making.</li>
            <li>Bees only eat pollen or bees only eat nectar.</li>
            <li>Pollen is a type of seed.</li>
