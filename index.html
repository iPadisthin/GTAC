<h2>Lesson 1 – Establishing prior knowledge and questions to investigate the statement: One in every three mouthfuls of food we eat relies on bees</h2>

<h3>Lesson Purpose</h3>
<p>The context of this lesson is based on the scientific concept of “one in every three mouthfuls of food we eat relies on bees”.</p> 
<p>The process and products of pollination are explored through the connection between bees, flowers and the food we eat. “It is estimated that 65% of all flowering plants and some seed plants (e.g. cycads and pines) require insects for pollination” (“Pollination”, 2015). On the other hand, insects like bees require certain type of plants for their main source of food – pollen.</p>
<p>In summary, this lesson will focus on what makes living organisms unique and what helps them survive and work together.</p>
